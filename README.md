Craigslist Post Filter
=======

I used to love browsing Craigslist Buy/Sell postings, before the ticket scalpers found out about it. These days, it's nearly impossible to read the buy/sell listings, since for every legitimate seller, there's 4 ticket scalpers trying to hock their crap.

In order to cut through the Ticket seller listings, I wrote this quick Chrome extension which hides any posting with the word "Ticket" in it, or that's in the ticket category.

TODO:
 - Style Options page

Until I get the packaged version hosted, the raw files can be enabled as follows:

 - Open chrome://extensions
 - Enable Developer Mode (checkbox at the top of the page)
 - Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and point to directory containing script files.

Version History:

0.1 - Filtered only the word "ticket"

0.2 - Added Options page, allowing customized keywords to be filtered from listings, keywords saved to chrome.storage. Renamed to Craigslist Post Filter.
