Scalped
=======

I used to love browsing Craigslist Buy/Sell postings, before the ticket scalpers found out about it. These days, it's nearly impossible to read the buy/sell listings, since for every legitimate seller, there's 4 ticket scalpers trying to hock their crap.

In order to cut through the Ticket seller listings, I wrote this quick Chrome extension which hides any posting with the word "Ticket" in it, or that's in the ticket category.

Down the road, it would be probably better to allow the word filter to be customized (i.e. hide tickets AND cars).

Until I get the packaged version hosted, the raw files can be enabled as follows:

 - Open chrome://extensions
 - Enable Developer Mode (checkbox at the top of the page)
 - Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and point to directory containing script files.
